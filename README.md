This keylogger is made to test offensive security using Python. When it is running on a computer, it can track the keystrokes inputted by the computer. 
ONLY USE THIS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This is to get a perspective of an ethical hacker and create something malicious that could be used to 
retrieve data like usernames and passwords. I utilized SMTP to send me an email of a "key_log.txt" file of all keystrokes inputted.
